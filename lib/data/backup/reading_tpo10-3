Seventeenth-Century European Economic Growth
<p><span class="question-1 question-2 paragraph-indicator hidden">&#9733;</span>In the late sixteenth century and into the seventeenth, Europe continued the growth that had lifted it out of the relatively less prosperous medieval period (from the mid 400s to the late 1400s). Among the <span class="question-highlight-2">key</span> factors behind this growth were increased agricultural productivity and an expansion of trade.</p>
<p><span class="question-3 paragraph-indicator hidden">&#9733;</span>Populations cannot grow unless the rural economy can produce enough additional food to feed more people. During the sixteenth century, farmers brought more land into cultivation at the expense of forests and fens (low-lying wetlands). Dutch land reclamation in the Netherlands in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries provides the most spectacular example of the expansion of farmland: the Dutch reclaimed more than 36.000 acres from 1590 to 1615 alone.</p>
<p><span class="question-4 paragraph-indicator hidden">&#9733;</span>Much of the potential for European economic development lay in what at first glance would seem to have been only sleepy villages. Such villages, however, generally lay in regions of relatively advanced agricultural production, permitting not only the survival of peasants but also the accumulation of an agricultural surplus for investment. They had access to urban merchants, markets, and trade routes.</p>
<p><span class="question-5 question-6 paragraph-indicator hidden">&#9733;</span>Increased agricultural production in turn facilitated rural industry, an intrinsic part of the expansion of industry. Woolens and textile manufacturers, in particular, utilized rural cottage (in-home) production, which took advantage of cheap and plentiful rural labor. In the German states, the ravages of the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) further moved textile production into the countryside. Members of poor peasant families spun or wove cloth and linens at home for scant remuneration in an attempt to supplement <span class="question-highlight-6">meager</span> family income.</p>
<p><span class="question-7 paragraph-indicator hidden">&#9733;</span>More extended trading networks also helped develop Europe's economy in this period. English and Dutch ships carrying rye from the Baltic states reached Spain and Portugal. Population growth generated an expansion of small-scale manufacturing, particularly of handicrafts, textiles, and metal production in England, Flanders, parts of northern Italy, the southwestern German states, and parts of Spain. Only iron smelting and mining required marshaling a significant amount of capital (wealth invested to create more wealth).</p>
<p><span class="question-8 question-9 question-13 question-14 paragraph-indicator hidden">&#9733;</span>The development of banking and other financial services contributed to the expansion of trade. By the middle of the sixteenth century, financiers and traders commonly accepted bills of exchange in place of gold or silver for other goods. Bills of exchange, which had their origins in medieval Italy, were promissory notes (written promises to pay a specified amount of money by a certain date) that could be sold to third parties. In this way, they provided credit. <span class="question-13 question-highlight-13 hidden">A</span>At mid-century, an Antwerp financier only slightly exaggerated when he claimed, "0ne can no more trade without bills of exchange than sail without water." <span class="question-13 question-highlight-13 hidden">B</span>Merchants no longer had to carry gold and silver over long, dangerous journeys. <span class="question-13 question-highlight-13 hidden">C</span>An Amsterdam merchant purchasing soap from a merchant in Marseille could go to an exchanger and pay the exchanger the equivalent sum in guilders, the Dutch currency. <span class="question-13 question-highlight-13 hidden">D</span>The exchanger would then send a bill of exchange to a colleague in Marseille, authorizing the colleague to pay the Marseille merchant in the merchant's own currency after the actual exchange of goods had taken place.</p>
<p><span class="question-10 paragraph-indicator hidden">&#9733;</span>Bills of exchange contributed to the development of banks, as exchangers began to provide loans. Not until the eighteenth century, however, did such banks as the Bank of Amsterdam and the Bank of England begin to provide capital for business investment. Their principal function was to provide funds for the state.</p>
<p><span class="question-11 question-12 paragraph-indicator hidden">&#9733;</span>The rapid expansion in international trade also benefitted from an infusion of capital, stemming largely from gold and silver brought by Spanish vessels from the Americas. This capital financed the production of goods, storage, trade, and even credit across Europe and overseas. Moreover an increased credit supply was generated by investments and loans by bankers and wealthy merchants to states and by joint-stock partnerships - an English innovation (the first major company began in 1600). Unlike short-term financial cooperation between investors for a single commercial undertaking, joint-stock companies provided permanent funding of capital by drawing on the investments of merchants and other investors who purchased shares in the company.</p>
