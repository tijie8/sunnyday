EXTINCTION OF THE DINOSAURS
<p><span class="question-1 paragraph-indicator hidden">&#9733;</span>Paleontologists have argued for a long time that the demise of the dinosaurs was caused by climatic alterations associated with slow changes in the positions of continents and seas resulting from plate tectonics. Off and on throughout the Cretaceous (the last period of the Mesozoic era, during which dinosaurs flourished), large shallow seas covered extensive areas of the continents. Data from diverse sources, including geochemical evidence preserved in seafloor sediments, indicate that the Late Cretaceous climate was milder than today’s. The days were not too hot, nor the nights too cold. The summers were not too warm, nor the winters too frigid. The shallow seas on the continents probably buffered the temperature of the nearby air, keeping it relatively constant.</p>
<p><span class="question-2 paragraph-indicator hidden">&#9733;</span>At the end of the Cretaceous, the geological record shows that these seaways retreated from the continents back into the major ocean basins. No one knows why. Over a period of about 100,000 years, while the seas pulled back, climates around the world became dramatically more extreme: warmer days, cooler nights; hotter summers, colder winters. Perhaps dinosaurs could not tolerate these extreme temperature changes and became extinct.</p>
<p><span class="question-3 question-4 question-5 question-6 paragraph-indicator hidden">&#9733;</span>If true, though, why did cold-blooded animals such as snakes, lizards, turtles, and crocodiles survive the freezing winters and torrid summers? These animals are at the mercy of the climate to maintain a livable body temperature. It’s hard to understand why they would not be affected, whereas dinosaurs were left too crippled to <span class="question-highlight-4">cope</span>, especially if, as some scientists believe, dinosaurs were warm-blooded. Critics also point out that the shallow seaways had retreated from and advanced on the continents numerous times during the Mesozoic, so why did the dinosaurs survive the climatic changes associated with the earlier <span class="question-highlight-6">fluctuations</span> but not with this one? Although initially appealing, the hypothesis of a simple climatic change related to sea levels is insufficient to explain all the data.</p>
<p><span class="question-7 question-8 paragraph-indicator hidden">&#9733;</span>Dissatisfaction with conventional explanations for dinosaur extinctions led to a surprising observation that, in turn, has suggested a new hypothesis. <span class="question-highlight-7">Many plants and animals disappear abruptly from the fossil record as one moves from layers of rock documenting the end of the Cretaceous up into rocks representing the beginning of the Cenozoic (the era after the Mesozoic).</span> Between the last layer of Cretaceous rock and the first layer of Cenozoic rock, there is often a thin layer of clay. Scientists felt that they could get an idea of how long the extinctions took by determining how long it took to deposit this one centimeter of clay and they thought they could determine the time it took to deposit the clay by determining the amount of the element iridium (lr) it contained.</p>
<p><span class="question-9 question-10 question-13 question-14 paragraph-indicator hidden">&#9733;</span>It has not been common at Earth’s since the very beginning of the planet’s history. Because it usually exists in a metallic state, it was preferentially incorporated in Earth’s core as the planet cooled and consolidated. Lr is found in high concentrations in some meteorites, in which the solar system’s original chemical composition is preserved. Even today, microscopic meteorites continually <span class="question-highlight-9">bombard</span> Earth, falling on both land and sea. By measuring how many of these meteorites fall to Earth over a given period of time, scientists can estimate how long it might have taken to deposit the observed amount of lr in the boundary clay. <span class="question-13 question-highlight-13 hidden">A</span>These calculations suggest that a period of about one million years would have been required. <span class="question-13 question-highlight-13 hidden">B</span>However, other reliable evidence suggests that the deposition of the boundary clay could not have taken one million years. <span class="question-13 question-highlight-13 hidden">C</span>So the unusually high concentration of lr seems to require a special explanation. <span class="question-13 question-highlight-13 hidden">D</span></p>
<p><span class="question-11 question-12 paragraph-indicator hidden">&#9733;</span>In view of these facts, scientists hypothesized that a single large asteroid, about 10 to 15 kilometers across, collided with Earth, and the resulting fallout created the boundary clay. Their calculations show that the impact kicked up a dust cloud that cut off sunlight for several months, inhibiting photosynthesis in plants; decreased surface temperatures on continents to below freezing; caused extreme episodes of acid rain; and significantly raised long-term global temperatures through the greenhouse effect. This <span class="question-highlight-11">disruption</span> of food chain and climate would have eradicated the dinosaurs and other organisms in less than fifty years.</p>
